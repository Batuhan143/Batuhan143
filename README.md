- 👋 Hi, I’m @Batuhan143
- 👀 I’m interested in data analyzing and machine learning in R and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python since it is wider-used than R. I have also studied R for 2 years but decided to switch to Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analyzing and visualizations and machine learning problems. ( prediction and classification as well as unsupervised learning)
- 📫 You can reach me on Linkedin, Batuhan Canbek, and here as well. I would love to collabrate and learn from everyone.
